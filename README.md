# food_delivery_time_prediction


**Overview:**

In the era of online businesses, predicting and optimizing food delivery time has become a critical aspect of customer satisfaction. This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to accurately estimate the delivery time for food orders. The model takes into account various factors such as the age and rating of the delivery partner, as well as the distance between the restaurant and the buyer's location.


**Key Objectives:**

1.**Accurate Delivery Time Estimation:** Improve customer confidence by providing precise estimates of when the food will arrive.

2.**Efficient Route Planning and Scheduling:** Optimize delivery routes and driver schedules based on predicted order volumes, enhancing resource utilization.

3.**Faster Deliveries:** Utilize historical delivery data to identify key attributes influencing delivery times, enabling faster and more efficient service.

4.**Business Growth through Customer Satisfaction:** Enhance overall business performance by satisfying customers with timely deliveries.


**Implementation Details:**

**Technologies Used:**

Python

TensorFlow

LSTM Neural Network


**Data Features:**

**Age of Delivery Partner:** The age of the delivery personnel.

**Partner's Rating:** The rating assigned to the delivery partner by customers.

**Distance Between Restaurant and Buyer's Location:** The geographical distance between the food establishment and the destination.


**Dataset:**

The dataset used for training and testing the LSTM model comprises historical delivery data with corresponding delivery times.


**Model Training:**

The LSTM neural network is trained on the provided dataset to learn patterns and relationships between input features (age, rating, distance) and delivery times.


**Usage:**

**Data Preparation:** Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately.

**Training:** Execute the training script to train the LSTM model.

**Prediction:** Utilize the trained model to predict food delivery times based on input parameters.
